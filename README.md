# Introduction to Machine Learning

This course is an introduction to the theory and techniques of machine learning for creating data-driven learning models.

## Course Objectives

### Knowledge and Understanding
Students will acquire a basic understanding of the most common techniques in supervised (and unsupervised) learning, as well as the ability to quantify and evaluate the performance of various models.

### Application of Knowledge
Students will be able to develop a machine learning model from scratch, starting from the preprocessing of raw data to the presentation of the final results in regression, classification, or clustering analysis.

### Communication Skills
Students will acquire the ability to present the results of the developed machine learning model along with an explanation of the motivations behind their choices.

### Learning Skills
Students will be able to navigate the machine learning literature and compare and improve their chosen models.
